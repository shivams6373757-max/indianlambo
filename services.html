<br>The Lamborghini design language, developed by Lamborghini Centro Stile, emphasizes determined proportions, clear contours, and precise lines. <br>These characteristics are evident in models like the Aventador, with its sleek, angular body, and the Urus, which blends muscular surfaces with elegant details. <br>The use of carbon fiber is particularly notable, contributing to the lightweight nature of the vehicles and allowing for complex, aerodynamically efficient shapes. <br>The surfaces are not just visually striking but also serve practical purposes, such as channeling airflow for cooling and downforce. 
<br>Furthermore, the surface design is a key element in conveying the brand's identity. <br>The hexagon and Y shapes, prominent features in Lamborghini's design history, are incorporated into various exterior elements, <br>from headlights to air intakes, further solidifying the brand's visual DNA. <br>The overall effect is a combination of aggressive styling and sophisticated design, creating vehicles that are both powerful and visually stunning.</p>
